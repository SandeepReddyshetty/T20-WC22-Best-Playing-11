## Description
This project focuses on performing a comprehensive data analysis of the WT20 World Cup, leveraging my skills as a data analyst and utilizing the power of Power BI. The aim was to identify the top 11 players of the tournament based on their batting, bowling, and overall performance statistics.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Collected reliable cricket statistics from sources like ESPN Cricinfo for the WT20 World Cup.
